"""Every GitHub workflow file parses and has jobs with runnable steps.

Measured 2026-09-06 on PR #376: four local gates and a line-by-line audit were
green while `.github/workflows/efc-verify.yml` was not valid YAML — a step
named `Check the efc: namespace (...)` puts `efc:` followed by a space in a
plain scalar, which YAML reads as a nested mapping. GitHub reported the run as
failed with no log. Nothing in the tree parsed the workflow files before this.
