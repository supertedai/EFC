\section{EFC-R Regime Model}

The EFC-R sector defines the galactic-scale regime of Energy-Flow Cosmology,
where spatial entropy gradients modify the effective gravitational potential
without altering cosmic expansion.

This sector is responsible for explaining galaxy rotation curves and
the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation using only baryonic matter and
entropy structure.

Mathematical details are provided in \texttt{minimal\_spec.tex}.
