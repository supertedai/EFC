# EFC-R Model (Regime Sector)

This directory contains the formal specification of the **EFC-R (Regime) sector**
of Energy-Flow Cosmology.

EFC-R governs **galactic-scale dynamics** where spatial entropy gradients
modify the effective gravitational potential without introducing dark matter
or altering cosmic expansion.

This model is:
- empirically validated against SPARC rotation curves
- mathematically closed at the regime level
- explicitly bounded in domain of applicability

EFC-R is a *sub-regime* of EFC-Core and does not modify global cosmology.

## Scope
- Galactic rotation curves
- Baryonic Tully–Fisher relation
- Low-acceleration, structured environments

## Excluded
- Galaxy clusters
- Early-universe cosmology
- Variable-speed-of-light effects

## Status
**Validated (SPARC, pilot N≈20)**  
**Stable core theory layer**

See `minimal_spec.tex` for the mathematical core.
