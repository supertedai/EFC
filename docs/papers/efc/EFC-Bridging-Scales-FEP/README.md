## Abstract

This work presents a formally constrained bridge between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC), linking variational free energy to measurable energy flow dynamics across entropy gradients.

We introduce an effective energy flow field with explicit dimensional meaning and show that a blanket-integrated scalar quantity is compatible with the extremization structure of variational free energy under non-equilibrium steady state conditions.

### Key Contributions

- **Markov blankets reinterpreted** as physical energy flow interfaces, characterized by zero flux or extremal gradient conditions
- **All core quantities explicitly defined**, dimensionally verified, and associated with clear falsification criteria
- **Resonance parameter** empirically motivated and explicitly non-universal by assumption, proposed as a stability threshold for self-organizing structures
- **Effective temperature** operationalized via fluctuation-dissipation relations

### Framework

The result is a theory-constrained and empirically testable framework that reframes the Free Energy Principle as an energetically grounded and scale-consistent analysis tool rather than a purely information-theoretic principle.

**No claims of empirical confirmation are made.** Instead, the work defines a minimal set of falsifiable predictions and measurement protocols that enable systematic empirical evaluation across biological, artificial, and physical systems.
