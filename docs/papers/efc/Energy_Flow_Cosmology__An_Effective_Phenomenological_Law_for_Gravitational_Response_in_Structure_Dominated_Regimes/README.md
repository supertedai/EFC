## Overview

This paper presents the theoretical derivation of the effective phenomenological law governing gravitational response in Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC). The central result is the effective gravitational coupling:

```
μ(a) = G_eff/G = 1 + βS(a)
```

where S(a) is the entropy field that activates during the transition from linear (L1) to non-linear (L2) cosmological regimes.

## Core Equations

**EFC Field Equation:**
```
G_μν = 8πG(T_μν + T^(Ef)_μν) + Λ_eff g_μν
```

**Effective Gravitational Coupling:**
```
μ(a) = G_eff/G = 1 + βS(a)
```

**Entropy Field Evolution:**
```
S(a) = (S_∞/2)[1 + tanh((ln a - ln a_t)/σ)]
```

**Regime Transition:**
- L0 (z > 1100): μ ≈ 1 (GR limit)
- L1 (1100 > z > 1): Linear perturbations
- L2 (z < 1): Structure-dominated, μ > 1

## Key Results

| Parameter | Value | Physical Meaning |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| β | ~0.16 | Coupling strength (~16% enhancement) |
| a_t | 0.55 | Transition scale factor (z ≈ 0.82) |
| σ | 0.10 | Transition width (sharp L1→L2) |
| S_∞ | 1.0 | Asymptotic entropy saturation |

## Theoretical Foundations

1. **Derived, not fitted**: μ(a) emerges from the EFC field equations, not phenomenological fitting
2. **Regime consistency**: Same S(a) governs both geometry and growth sectors
3. **GR recovery**: Automatic suppression in early universe (G_CMB ≈ 10⁻¹²)
4. **Falsifiable**: Specific predictions for late-time observables
