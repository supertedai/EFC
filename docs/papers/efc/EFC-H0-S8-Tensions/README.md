## Abstract

The Hubble tension (H₀ = 73.0 ± 1.0 km/s/Mpc locally vs. 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc from CMB) and the S8 tension (σ₈ suppression in late-universe probes) represent the most significant challenges to the standard ΛCDM cosmological model.

We present an analysis within the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) framework demonstrating that both tensions can be resolved simultaneously through a single physical mechanism: **entropy-dependent modification of how local observations are mapped to global cosmological parameters**.

### Key Insight

The tensions arise not from different expansion rates or gravitational strengths in different regions, but from **systematic biases in inferring global parameters from local measurements when entropy gradients are present**.

### Results

Using the validated EFC sector—comprising an effective gravitational coupling G_eff(S) = G_N(1+βS) with β < 0 and entropy-dependent growth damping—we achieve:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| H₀ tension resolution | Δχ² = 40.29 improvement |
| S8 tension reduction | 3.3σ → 0.3σ |
| BAO consistency | ✓ Full |
| SNe Ia consistency | ✓ Full |
| CMB distance constraints | ✓ Full |

### Critical Note

This is accomplished **without modifying**:
- The cosmic expansion history H(z)
- The sound horizon r_d
- Early-universe physics

The approach explicitly separates the validated core of EFC from experimental extensions, providing a falsifiable framework with clear domain of validity.
