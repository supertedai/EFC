# EBE Project - Scope, Claims, and Limitations
## Critical Scientific Boundaries Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Author:** Morten Magnusson  
**Purpose:** Explicit documentation of what IS and IS NOT claimed  

---

## Framework Note

This work establishes Entropy-Bounded Empiricism (EBE) as an epistemological constraint on model validity. Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) is used here as a concrete test case, not as a prerequisite for the framework. The EBE framework stands independently of any specific physical theory.

---

## 🎯 What We ARE Claiming

### 1. Regime Structure Exists (SPARC175)
**Claim:** Galaxy rotation curves exhibit statistically significant regime-dependent behavior.

**Evidence:**
- Mann-Whitney U: p < 0.0001
- Kruskal-Wallis H: p = 0.012
- Permutation test: p = 0.016
- Effect size: Cliff's Î´ = 0.371 (medium-large)

**Scope:** Limited to SPARC sample (N=175)
**Status:** Solid statistical evidence

---

### 2. Regime Classification is Model-Blind
**Claim:** L-value proxy is computed BEFORE model fitting, independent of EFC or Î›CDM.

**Evidence:**
- L calculation uses only rotation curve shape
- No model parameters in regime assignment
- Regime boundaries empirically derived from data

**Scope:** Methodological independence demonstrated
**Status:** Verifiable and reproducible

---

### 3. CMB Shows No Regime Structure (Critical Validation)
**Claim:** CMB angular power spectrum does NOT exhibit regime separation.

**Evidence:**
- CMB null test: p = 0.251 (not significant)
- Effect size: Î´ = 0.04 (negligible)

**Theoretical prediction:** CMB at equilibrium (S â‰ˆ 0.5) should fail regime test

**Scope:** Distinguishes genuine effect from methodological artifact
**Status:** PASS - critical validation confirmed

---

### 4. EBE Framework is Independent of EFC
**Claim:** Entropy-bounded empiricism stands as epistemological framework regardless of EFC's fate.

**Evidence:**
- L-proxy detects regime structure with or without EFC
- Regime boundaries exist independent of theoretical interpretation
- CMB null test is consistent with empirical boundary concept

**Scope:** EBE is framework; EFC is one possible physical interpretation
**Status:** Conceptually separable

---

## âš ï¸ What We ARE NOT Claiming

### 1. EFC is a Complete Physical Theory
**NOT claiming:**
- âœ— Full quantitative CMB prediction
- âœ— Closed PDE system for all scenarios
- âœ— Boltzmann code implementation
- âœ— Gravitational wave predictions validated

**Reality:**
- EFC is hypothesis-stage framework
- Field equations exist but not fully tested
- CMB interpretation is qualitative, not quantitative
- Peer review is critical bottleneck

**Gap documentation:**
- No independent replication yet (LITTLE THINGS pending)
- Single dataset (SPARC only)
- L-definition has degrees of freedom (but robust across variants)

---

### 2. Regime Effect Proven Beyond SPARC
**NOT claiming:**
- âœ— Universal applicability across all galaxy surveys
- âœ— Effect size will replicate exactly in other datasets
- âœ— No quality confound exists

**Reality:**
- Quality-L correlation: Ï = -0.43 (moderate confound)
- Effect strengthens in high-quality subsample (argues against pure artifact)
- Replication needed: LITTLE THINGS, DMS surveys

**Honest assessment:**
- Pattern is consistent but limited to one survey
- Quality may be moderator, not pure confound
- Independent validation is next critical step

---

### 3. 100% Success Rate is Fundamental Law
**NOT claiming:**
- âœ— FLOW regime will always give 100% success
- âœ— No FLOW galaxy can ever fail EFC fit
- âœ— This is a universal constant

**Reality:**
- 100% success in FLOW (62/62) is empirical observation in SPARC
- May not hold exactly in other datasets
- Success threshold (Ï‡Â² < 3) is conventional, not fundamental

**Proper framing:**
- Unprecedented consistency in FLOW regime
- Strong pattern, not absolute law
- Replication will test robustness

---

### 4. All Cosmological Problems are Solved
**NOT claiming:**
- ✗ Dark matter fully reframed
- ✗ Dark energy fully reframed
- âœ— CMB anomalies fully resolved
- âœ— Hâ‚€ tension fully resolved

**Reality:**
- EBE/EFC reframes problems as regime-dependent
- Does not provide complete solutions
- Some predictions (e.g., CMB low-â„“) are qualitative

**Proper framing:**
- Framework for understanding problem structure
- Not a "theory of everything"
- Complementary to other approaches

---

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Integrity Guardrails

### 1. Language Discipline
**Avoid:**
- "Proves" â†’ Use "provides evidence for"
- "Solves" â†’ Use "addresses" or "reframes"
- "Theory" â†’ Use "framework" or "hypothesis"
- "Universal" â†’ Use "observed in SPARC175"

**Use:**
- "Regime structure is statistically robust in SPARC"
- "CMB null test is consistent with empirical boundary concept"
- "Effect strengthens in high-quality subsample"
- "Independent replication is critical next step"

---

### 2. Confound Transparency
**Quality-L Correlation (Ï = -0.43):**

**Honest assessment:**
- Moderate confound exists
- BUT: Effect strengthens in high-quality data (Î´ = 0.69, p = 0.001)
- Pattern inconsistent with pure artifact

**Reviewer response:**
- Acknowledge confound explicitly
- Present stratified analysis
- Argue pattern contradicts artifact explanation
- Request independent validation

---

### 3. Statistical Humility
**Effect Size Context:**
- Cliff's Î´ = 0.371 (medium-large)
- This is substantial but not enormous
- Romano et al. (2006): 0.330 â‰¤ Î´ < 0.474 = medium

**Proper framing:**
- "Medium-to-large practical significance"
- "Represents meaningful physical difference"
- NOT "overwhelming" or "irrefutable"

---

### 4. Replication Requirement
**Current status:**
- N=20 pilot â†’ N=175 full (replicated scaling)
- But: single survey (SPARC only)

**Next critical steps:**
1. LITTLE THINGS survey (~40 dwarf galaxies)
2. DMS survey (~300 dwarf galaxies)
3. Cross-domain testing (if applicable)

**Timeline:**
- SPARC analysis: Complete
- MNRAS submission: Q1 2026 (ready)
- Independent replication: 2026-2027 (pending)

---

### For Community:
**Invitation:** "Here is a framework and a pattern. Test it on your data."

**Transparency:** "Quality confound exists but pattern argues against artifact."

**Humility:** "This reframes problems; it does not solve everything."
