## Abstract

We analyze 20 galaxies from the SPARC database using the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) framework, finding systematic patterns in where EFC succeeds versus fails. Rather than treating mixed results as theoretical failure, we develop **EFC-R (Regime)**: a meta-framework that operationalizes regime-dependent validity through the decomposition:

```
E_total = E_flow + E_latent
```

This provides a principled structure for understanding when and why EFC succeeds or fails.

### Key Findings

| Galaxy Category | N | Success Rate | Representative Galaxies |
|-----------------|---|--------------|------------------------|
| LSB galaxies | 5 | 100% | F568-3, F563-1, F571-8 |
| Dwarf irregulars | 5 | 80% | DDO154, DDO168, DDO064 |
| Spiral galaxies | 8 | 75% | NGC2403, NGC6503, NGC3198 |
| Barred/disturbed | 2 | 0% | NGC2841, DDO170 |
| **Total** | **20** | **80%** | |

### Statistical Results

- **Spearman ρ = 0.705** (p = 0.0005): Strong rank correlation between structural complexity and model preference
- **EFC mean χ²_red: 26.2** vs **ΛCDM mean χ²_red: 69.6**
- Mean entropy gradient: ∇S = (8.20 ± 2.44) × 10⁻² kpc⁻¹

### FIRE Simulation Convergence

EFC-R's regime-dependent pattern aligns with independent findings from FIRE hydrodynamical simulations:

| FIRE Finding | EFC-R Interpretation |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Bursty star formation → non-equilibrium | High E_latent, α→0 |
| Dark matter cores in late-forming systems | Regime transition S₀→S₁ |
| Stable cusps in early-forming systems | Stable α≈1 regime |
| Oscillating inner slopes | Tipping point dynamics |

### Scope Limitations

This is a **pilot study (N=20)**. Results are hypothesis-generating and motivate, but do not complete, a full theoretical treatment of EFC-R. Independent validation on larger samples is essential.
