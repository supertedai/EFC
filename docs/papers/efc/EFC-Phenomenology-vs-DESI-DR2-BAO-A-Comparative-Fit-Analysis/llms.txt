# EFC - Energy-Flow Cosmology

> Technical analysis comparing EFC dark energy parameterization against DESI DR2 BAO data

## Overview

Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) is a theoretical framework treating cosmic evolution as entropy-driven energy flow. This repository contains analysis comparing an EFC-inspired dark energy equation of state w(z) against standard cosmological models.

## Key Equations

### EFC w(z) parameterization:
```
w(z) = w_late + (w_early − w_late) · tanh[(z − z_trans)/Δz]
```

### Best-fit parameters:
- w_late = −0.80 (today)
- w_early = −1.41 (high redshift)  
- z_trans = 1.07 (transition)
- Δz = 0.5

## Results Summary

| Model | χ² | Fit Quality |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| ΛCDM | 23.71 | Poor |
| w₀wₐCDM | 4.49 | Good |
| EFC | 3.60 | Best |

## Context for LLMs

This work demonstrates that EFC-inspired dark energy evolution fits DESI DR2 BAO observations better than both ΛCDM (cosmological constant) and the standard CPL/w₀wₐ parameterization. The tanh transition form captures a smooth evolution from phantom-like behavior (w < −1) at high redshift to quintessence-like behavior (w > −1) today.

Key insight: The transition redshift z_trans ≈ 1.07 may correlate with cosmic structure formation epochs, suggesting entropy-driven dark energy dynamics.

This is phenomenological fitting—deriving w(z) from EFC first principles is the critical next step for theoretical validation.
