This document defines the L0–L3 regime architecture underlying Entropy-Bounded Empiricism (EBE) in Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC). The framework distinguishes four operational regimes: L0 (latent potential), L1–L2 (active/life phase), and L3 (residual structure), connected by phase-extended transitions. This architecture prevents *regime leakage*—the misapplication of inference rules across incompatible dynamical phases. While developed for cosmological modeling, the framework applies to any system governed by energy flow, entropy gradients, and informational constraints. The regime structure clarifies when empirical inference remains valid and when it breaks down due to phase boundaries or deactivation. This is a foundational concept document intended as a reference for EBE/EFC research and as a supplement to full publications.
