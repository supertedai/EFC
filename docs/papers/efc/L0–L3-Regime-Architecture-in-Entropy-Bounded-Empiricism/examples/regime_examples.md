This document provides concrete examples of how the L0–L3 regime architecture applies across different domains.

## Example 1: Biological System (Human Life Cycle)

### L0 — Latent Phase
- **State:** Genetic information in gametes before fertilization
- **Characteristics:** DNA structure exists but is not expressed as a living organism
- **Energy flow:** Minimal metabolic activity
- **Inference validity:** Can analyze genetic potential, cannot predict phenotype without activation

### L0 → L1 Transition (Activation)
- **Process:** Fertilization → embryonic development → birth
- **Thresholds:** Cell division begins, metabolic pathways activate, feedback systems emerge
- **Duration:** ~9 months (phase-extended)

### L1 — Stable Active Phase
- **State:** Childhood through early adulthood
- **Characteristics:** Predictable growth, stable homeostasis, low entropy production
- **Energy flow:** Efficient metabolism, stable basal rate
- **Inference validity:** Growth models work, linear predictions reliable

### L1 → L2 Transition (Complexification)
- **Process:** Maturation, peak physical capacity, beginning of senescence
- **Characteristics:** Increasing biological complexity, wear accumulation

### L2 — Complex Active Phase
- **State:** Middle to late adulthood
- **Characteristics:** Non-linear aging, accumulated damage, increased entropy production
- **Energy flow:** Less efficient metabolism, increased maintenance costs
- **Inference validity:** Non-linear models required, long-term prediction limited

### L2 → L3 Transition (Deactivation)
- **Process:** Progressive system failure, loss of homeostasis
- **Thresholds:** Metabolic capacity falls below maintenance minimum
- **Duration:** Variable (can be gradual or rapid)

### L3 — Residual Phase
- **State:** Post-mortem biological structure
- **Characteristics:** DNA and structural proteins persist without active metabolism
- **Energy flow:** Zero (no active biological processes)
- **Inference validity:** Forensic analysis valid, historical reconstruction possible, active biology inference invalid

### L3 → L0 (Cyclical)
- **Process:** Genetic material may contribute to future offspring (new L0 state)
- **Note:** This is not reanimation but information transfer to new cycles

## Example 2: Ecological System (Forest Succession)

### L0 — Latent Phase
- **State:** Seed bank in soil after disturbance
- **Characteristics:** Dormant seeds with germination potential
- **Energy flow:** None (dormancy)

### L0 → L1 Transition
- **Process:** Seeds germinate after disturbance (fire, clearing)
- **Thresholds:** Water availability, temperature, light conditions meet germination requirements

### L1 — Stable Active Phase
- **State:** Pioneer species establishment (grasses, shrubs)
- **Characteristics:** Rapid growth, simple community structure, predictable succession
- **Energy flow:** High primary productivity, efficient resource use

### L2 — Complex Active Phase
- **State:** Mature forest
- **Characteristics:** Complex trophic networks, high biodiversity, non-linear dynamics
- **Energy flow:** Balanced production/decomposition, high structural complexity

### L2 → L3 Transition
- **Process:** Senescence, disease, or disturbance causes forest decline
- **Thresholds:** Mortality exceeds recruitment, nutrient cycling breaks down

### L3 — Residual Phase
- **State:** Dead standing timber, fallen logs, soil organic matter
- **Characteristics:** Structure persists without active growth
- **Energy flow:** Zero (decomposition by external agents)

### L3 → L0 (Cyclical)
- **Process:** Organic matter enriches soil, seeds remain viable, new succession can begin

## Example 3: Economic System (Company Lifecycle)

### L0 — Latent Phase
- **State:** Business concept before incorporation
- **Characteristics:** Plans, potential team, market analysis exist but no operations
- **Energy flow:** No revenue, no operational expenses

### L0 → L1 Transition
- **Process:** Company incorporation, initial funding, hiring
- **Thresholds:** Capital secured, team assembled, product development begins

### L1 — Stable Active Phase
- **State:** Established operations with predictable revenue
- **Characteristics:** Stable growth, clear business model, efficient operations
- **Energy flow:** Consistent cash flow, predictable costs

### L2 — Complex Active Phase
- **State:** Mature company with market dominance
- **Characteristics:** Complex organizational structure, multiple product lines, non-linear market dynamics
- **Energy flow:** Large revenue but also large operational complexity

### L2 → L3 Transition
- **Process:** Declining competitiveness, market disruption
- **Thresholds:** Revenue falls below operational costs, unable to adapt

### L3 — Residual Phase
- **State:** Defunct company
- **Characteristics:** Intellectual property, brand name, physical assets remain
- **Energy flow:** Zero active operations

### L3 → L0 (Cyclical)
- **Process:** Assets acquired by new ventures, IP licensed, lessons inform new startups

## Example 4: Cognitive System (Learning a Skill)

### L0 — Latent Phase
- **State:** Neural substrate before skill acquisition
- **Characteristics:** Brain has capacity to learn but skill is not present
- **Energy flow:** Baseline neural activity

### L0 → L1 Transition
- **Process:** Initial instruction, practice begins
- **Thresholds:** Repeated exposure, attention, motivation sufficient for learning

### L1 — Stable Active Phase
- **State:** Skill proficiency achieved
- **Characteristics:** Automatic execution, low cognitive load, predictable performance
- **Energy flow:** Efficient neural processing

### L2 — Complex Active Phase
- **State:** Expert-level performance
- **Characteristics:** Context-dependent adaptation, creative application, non-linear improvement
- **Energy flow:** Higher neural engagement for novel contexts

### L2 → L3 Transition
- **Process:** Skill disuse, neurological decline
- **Thresholds:** Practice frequency drops below maintenance threshold

### L3 — Residual Phase
- **State:** Dormant skill
- **Characteristics:** Memory traces persist but cannot be actively executed
- **Energy flow:** No active skill deployment

### L3 → L0 (Cyclical)
- **Process:** Skill can be relearned faster (savings effect) - L3 traces reduce relearning time

## Example 5: Technological System (Software Application)

### L2 → L3 Transition
- **Process:** Service shutdown, decommissioning
- **Thresholds:** Support ended, dependencies outdated, usage drops to zero

### L3 — Residual Phase

### L3 → L0 (Cyclical)
- **Process:** Code reused in new projects, design patterns influence future systems

## Regime Leakage Examples

### Invalid: Applying L1 linear model to L2 complex system
**Error:** Using simple growth projections for a mature company in disrupted markets  
**Result:** Predictions fail due to non-linear dynamics

### Invalid: Treating L3 residue as L2 active system
**Error:** Assuming fossil record reflects current biological processes  
**Result:** Confusing historical structure with active dynamics

### Invalid: Inferring causal history in L0
**Error:** Claiming genetic potential has a "history" before activation  
**Result:** Teleological fallacy, treating potential as if it had temporal trajectory

**Note:** These examples demonstrate the generality of the L0–L3 architecture across domains. The framework is not cosmology-specific but applies wherever energy flow, entropy gradients, and phase transitions govern system behavior.
