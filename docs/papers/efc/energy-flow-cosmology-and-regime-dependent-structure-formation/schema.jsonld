  "description": "Introduces Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) as a physical framework consistent with empirical regime structure in galaxy dynamics (SPARC) and early universe structure formation (JWST COSMOS-Web). The phenomenological decomposition E_total = E_flow + E_latent provides a unified interpretation without replacing ΛCDM.",
  "abstract": "Papers I and II of this series established empirical regime structure in two independent datasets: (I) morphology-dependent rotation curve behavior in 175 SPARC galaxies, and (II) order-of-magnitude galaxy abundance excesses at z > 6 in JWST COSMOS-Web data. This third paper introduces Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) as a physical framework consistent with both findings. The core mechanism is entropy-gradient-driven energy flow, introduced through the phenomenological decomposition E_total = E_flow + E_latent. We show that this framework is consistent with: (i) the three-regime classification (FLOW, TRANSITION, LATENT) observed in galactic dynamics, and (ii) accelerated structure formation in the early universe. The interpretation is offered as an organizing framework, not a replacement for ΛCDM.",
