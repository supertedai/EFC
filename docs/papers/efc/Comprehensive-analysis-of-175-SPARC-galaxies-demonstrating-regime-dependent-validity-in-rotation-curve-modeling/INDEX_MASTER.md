**Contains:**
- Theory (strong)
- Implementation attempts (failed)
- Independent evidence (excellent)
- Meta-framework (ready)
- Honest limitations
- Path forward

**Read this first** for complete picture.

**Contains:**
- Detailed theory (two formulations)
- All implementation attempts with χ² values
- Systematic regime mapping
- What failed & why
- What succeeded & why

**Read this second** for technical depth.

---

#### 3. **ENTROPY_BOUNDED_EMPIRICITY.md** 🌟 META-FRAMEWORK
**Purpose:** Universal principle across domains  
**Contains:**
- L0-L3 epistemic structure
- Why empiricism requires 0.1 < S < 0.9
- Cross-domain isomorphism (physics/economics/biology/cognition)
- Falsifiable predictions
- Why all theories fail at same boundaries

**This is the core theoretical contribution** - ready for publication.

---

#### 4. **efc_r_verification_protocol.md** ✅ INDEPENDENT VALIDATION
**Purpose:** Evidence from OTHER fields supporting regime structure  
**Contains:**
- FIRE simulations (excellent match)
- Bullet Cluster (strong support)
- Diversity problem (reframed)
- LITTLE THINGS (consistent)
- Gravitational lensing (implicit)

**This shows field ALREADY found the pattern.**

## 🎯 QUICK NAVIGATION

### By Purpose:

**Want complete overview?**  
→ Read `COMPLETE_EVIDENCE_PACKAGE.md`

**Want technical details?**  
→ Read `EFC_R_COMPLETE_ASSESSMENT.md`

**Want theoretical framework?**  
→ Read `ENTROPY_BOUNDED_EMPIRICITY.md`

**Want independent validation?**  
→ Read `efc_r_verification_protocol.md`

---

### By Question:

**"Does EFC-R fit SPARC data?"**  
→ NO. See Section 2 in COMPLETE_EVIDENCE_PACKAGE.md  
→ Implementation failed, cannot reproduce N=20 results

**"Is the theory sound?"**  
→ YES. See Section 1 in EFC_R_COMPLETE_ASSESSMENT.md  
→ Mathematically correct, gauge-invariant, epistemically structured

**"Is there independent evidence?"**  
→ YES. See efc_r_verification_protocol.md  
→ FIRE simulations, Bullet Cluster, diversity problem all support regime structure

**"What is entropy-bounded empiricity?"**  
→ See ENTROPY_BOUNDED_EMPIRICITY.md  
→ Universal principle: empirical science exists only where 0.1 < S < 0.9

**"What can you claim?"**  
→ See Section 7 in COMPLETE_EVIDENCE_PACKAGE.md  
✅ Regime structure supported  
✅ Meta-framework empirically grounded  
❌ SPARC fits NOT validated

**"What's the path forward?"**  
→ See Section 8 in COMPLETE_EVIDENCE_PACKAGE.md  
→ Paper 1: Meta-framework (READY)  
→ Paper 2: Empirical validation (CONDITIONAL)

## 🔬 SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY

**What this archive demonstrates:**

✅ **Honest science**
- Shows ALL attempts (not just successes)
- Documents failures with data (χ² values)
- Explains what works and why
- States limitations clearly
- Provides actionable path

✅ **Strong foundation despite implementation gap**
- Mathematical structure sound
- Independent convergent evidence
- Meta-framework empirically grounded
- Falsifiable predictions
- Unifies existing observations

❌ **Does NOT claim**
- SPARC validation
- Reproduced N=20 results
- Found empirical success regime
- Model proven

✅ **DOES claim**
- Regime structure predicted
- Independent evidence supports
- Meta-framework ready
- Framework unifies existing "problems"

---

## 💡 KEY FINDING

**The astrophysics community has INDEPENDENTLY discovered regime-dependent behavior.**

What they call:
- Cusp-core problem
- Too big to fail
- Diversity problem
- Non-equilibrium effects

**EFC-R provides the unifying framework.**

This is NOT "we need more data."

This IS "field has data, here's the framework."

**That's how paradigm shifts happen.**
