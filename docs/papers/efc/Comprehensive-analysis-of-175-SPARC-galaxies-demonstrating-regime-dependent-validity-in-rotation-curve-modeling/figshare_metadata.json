  "title": "Regime-Dependent Validity in Galaxy Rotation Curve Modeling: Comprehensive Analysis of 175 SPARC Galaxies",
  "description": "We present a comprehensive analysis of 175 galaxies from the SPARC database, extending our pilot N=20 study. Using an ultra-phenomenological fitting model, we demonstrate robust evidence for regime-dependent validity: the model achieves 100% success rate in low-complexity systems (FLOW regime, 35% of sample) but systematically fails in high-complexity systems (LATENT regime, 15% of sample). Statistical testing confirms regimes are significantly separated (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.0001). This validates the core prediction of EFC-R: gravitational dynamics exhibit distinct domains of validity defined by system complexity.",
