# Figshare Integration for EFC

This directory stores DOI metadata, versioned Figshare artifacts,
and synchronization outputs used by the EFC semantic and publication pipeline.

The directory is fully managed by the Figshare Sync workflow and is isolated
from the rest of the repository to ensure stability and non-destructive updates.
